# t3
An open source hobby game framework done by tictactoe game developer community

### prerequisites
* a compiler which can "Hello World" in c & c++

### how to install
* Before building the SDL library, please consider building it under project root, inside a folder `SDL_Build`. This will make everything easier for you (You won't need to edit CMakeList.txt too much)  
* You should build [SDL-release-2.28.5](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5) first 
* If you're having trouble with installing SDL, read the tutorial from here: [Lazy Foo's SDL Tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php)
